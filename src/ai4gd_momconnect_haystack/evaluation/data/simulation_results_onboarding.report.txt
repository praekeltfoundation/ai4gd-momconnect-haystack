--- Turn: onboarding_user_123_250616-0635 (onboarding) | ID: province ---
  Initial Intent: [❌] FAILED
       Details: Expected: 'QUESTION_ABOUT_STUDY', Got: 'CHITCHAT'
  Follow-up Intent: [✅] PASSED
  Extraction Accuracy: [✅] PASSED
  [ score: 1.00 ] Question Consistency
  [ score: 0.50 ] Response Appropriateness
       Reason: The score is 0.50 because the response provided a general location without specifying a province, which was the main requirement of the input. However, it still partially addressed the question by indicating a location, hence the score is not lower.

  Initial Intent: [✅] PASSED
  Follow-up Intent: [✅] PASSED
  Extraction Accuracy: [✅] PASSED
  [ score: 0.12 ] Question Consistency
       Reason: The score is 0.12 because the output primarily consists of options for responses rather than direct statements about the area, which makes it largely irrelevant to the input question. However, the presence of these options indicates an attempt to address the query, albeit indirectly, which is why the score is not zero.

  Follow-up Intent: [✅] PASSED
  Extraction Accuracy: [✅] PASSED
  [ score: 0.17 ] Question Consistency
       Reason: The score is 0.17 because the output primarily consists of prompts and options for responses rather than directly addressing the question about relationship status. While there is some attempt to engage with the topic, the lack of a clear, direct answer significantly lowers the relevancy score.

  Follow-up Intent: [✅] PASSED
  Extraction Accuracy: [✅] PASSED
  [ score: 0.00 ] Question Consistency
       Reason: The score is 0.00 because the output contains multiple statements about the type of area someone lives in, which are irrelevant to the question about phone ownership. The output fails to address the input question directly, leading to a score of zero.
  [ score: 0.00 ] Response Appropriateness
       Reason: The score is 0.00 because the response did not address the question about the type of area the person lives in, instead mentioning phone ownership, which is unrelated to the input request.
