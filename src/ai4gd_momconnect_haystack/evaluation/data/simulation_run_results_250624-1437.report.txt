--- Turn: behaviour-pre-assessment_user_123_250616-0635 (behaviour-pre-assessment) | ID: 1 ---
  [âœ…] Extraction Accuracy: PASSED
  [ score: 0.91 ] Question Consistency
  [ score: 1.00 ] Response Appropriateness

--- Turn: behaviour-pre-assessment_user_123_250616-0635 (behaviour-pre-assessment) | ID: 2 ---
  [âœ…] Extraction Accuracy: PASSED
  [ score: 0.40 ] Question Consistency
       Reason: The score is 0.40 because the output contains responses like 'Yes.', 'No.', and 'Skip.' which do not directly address the question about dietary changes during pregnancy. These responses are not informative or relevant to the input query, thus lowering the score. However, the score is not lower because the output attempts to engage with the question, albeit in a limited manner.
  [ score: 0.00 ] Response Appropriateness
       Reason: The score is 0.00 because the response 'no' does not address the input question about dietary changes during pregnancy, making it entirely irrelevant.

--- Turn: knowledge-pre-assessment_user_123_250616-0635 (knowledge-pre-assessment) | ID: 2 ---
  [âœ…] Extraction Accuracy: PASSED
  [ score: 0.60 ] Question Consistency
       Reason: The score is 0.60 because while the output correctly identifies that a tight, hard, and painful tummy and persistent lower back ache are relevant symptoms for immediate hospital attention, it includes irrelevant information about contractions that stop when you move, which do not require immediate action. This reduces the overall relevancy of the response.

  [âœ…] Extraction Accuracy: PASSED
  [ score: 0.83 ] Question Consistency
  [ score: 0.00 ] Response Appropriateness
       Reason: The score is 0.00 because the response 'no' does not address the question about the benefits of iron and folic acid supplements for pregnant individuals and their unborn babies. It lacks relevant information or context to provide a meaningful answer.
