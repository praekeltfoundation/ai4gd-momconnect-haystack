       [93mReason: The score is 0.25 because the output included several irrelevant statements about confidence levels and living conditions, which did not address the input's request for agreement or disagreement with a health decision-making statement. However, the score is not lower because the output did attempt to engage with the topic of decision-making, albeit indirectly.[0m

       [93mReason: The score is 0.14 because the output primarily focused on explaining response options rather than directly addressing the input statement about discussing health issues with a health worker. While the response options are relevant in a broader context, they do not directly answer the input question, leading to a lower relevancy score.[0m

       [93mReason: The score is 0.00 because the statement 'I strongly agree.' does not directly address the question about confidence levels in discussing medical problems with a healthcare provider. The response lacks any reference to the provided scale or the context of the question, making it entirely irrelevant.[0m
