  Initial Intent: [✅] PASSED
  Follow-up Intent: [✅] PASSED
  Extraction Accuracy: [✅] PASSED
  [ score: 0.18 ] Question Consistency
       Reason: The score is 0.18 because the output contains multiple statements that do not directly address the input question, leading to a low relevancy score. However, the presence of some relevant content prevents the score from being zero.

  [ score: 0.20 ] Question Consistency
       Reason: The score is 0.20 because the output primarily consists of response format prompts and options, which do not directly address the input question about dietary changes during pregnancy. The presence of these irrelevant statements significantly lowers the relevancy score.

  [ score: 0.50 ] Question Consistency

  [ score: 0.20 ] Question Consistency

  [ score: 0.22 ] Question Consistency
       Reason: The score is 0.22 because the output contains multiple irrelevant statements that do not directly address the question about the timing of a first pregnancy check-up. These include prompts for response formats, instructions to skip questions, and incorrect suggestions about check-up timing. However, the score is not zero because there is an attempt to engage with the input, albeit not effectively.

  [ score: 0.50 ] Question Consistency
       Reason: The score is 0.50 because while the output includes some relevant information about when to go to the hospital during pregnancy, it also contains irrelevant statements such as 'contractions stop' and options like 'I don't know' and 'skip,' which do not directly address the input question.

  [ score: 0.67 ] Question Consistency
       Reason: The score is 0.67 because the response partially addresses the benefits of iron and folic acid supplements for pregnancy, but includes a prompt for user interaction that doesn't directly answer the question. This slightly detracts from the overall relevance, preventing a higher score.
  [ score: 0.00 ] Response Appropriateness
