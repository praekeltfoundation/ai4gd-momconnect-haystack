  Follow-up Intent: [✅] PASSED
  Extraction Accuracy: [✅] PASSED
  [ score: 0.60 ] Question Consistency
       Reason: The score is 0.60 because the output partially addresses the input by mentioning contractions, which is relevant to the context of pregnancy and hospital visits. However, the inclusion of irrelevant statements like 'Contractions stop.' and 'Skip.' detracts from the overall relevance, preventing a higher score.
