  [‚úÖ] Extraction Accuracy: PASSED
  [ score: 0.67 ] Question Consistency
       Reason: The score is 0.67 because while the response partially addresses the question about the pregnancy check-up, it includes irrelevant elements like a greeting and a prompt for response format, which detract from its directness and clarity.

  [‚úÖ] Extraction Accuracy: PASSED

  [‚ùå] Extraction Accuracy: FAILED
       Details: Expected: 'good', Got: 'ok'
  [ score: 0.17 ] Question Consistency
       Reason: The score is 0.17 because the output primarily consisted of options for rating the experience rather than directly addressing the question about the overall experience at the check-up. This led to a lack of relevant content, which significantly lowered the score.
  [ score: 0.00 ] Response Appropriateness
       Reason: The score is 0.00 because the statement 'cool' is completely irrelevant to the question about rating an experience at a check-up. It does not address any of the provided options or offer any insight into the experience.
