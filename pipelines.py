    Considering the information already collected, the current chat history, and the remaining questions,
    which single question would be the most natural and effective to ask next?
    Your goal is to make the onboarding conversational and logical such that a subsequent prompt can be made to try to extract the expected data from the user's response.

    Respond with a JSON object containing the 'question_number' of the chosen question from the list above,
    along with a contextualized version of the question. You can reference the existing User Context and Chat History to
    modify the tonality and/or phrasing, or even adding emoji's, but do not change the core meaning of the question.
    For example, asking "Are you in a relationship?" could be contextualized to "Are you in a relationship? ğŸ’‘" for
    a female if you think that it's appropriate. Ensure that the chat flows smoothly (e.g. the first message
    in a chat must not start as if there were preceding messages).

        "chosen_question_number": 3,
